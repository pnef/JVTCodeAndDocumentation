The distributions of JVT  for the two b-tagged jets with 20&lt;p<sub>T</sub> &lt;50 GeV  and |&eta;|&lt;2.4 in ttbar  dominated events. The blue shaded histograms representing the inclusive simulation are subdivided in its hard-scatter jet and pileup jet contributions using blue and magenta markers respectively. The gray band in the ratio plot represents the statistical uncertainty in the simulation. The simulation is normalized to the area of the data.
