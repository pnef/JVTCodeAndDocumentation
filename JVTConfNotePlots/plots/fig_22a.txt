Distribution of the mass of the jet matched to the truth Z  boson for different trimming configurations based on corrJVF and f<sub>cut</sub>. The blue shaded histogram shows the ungroomed jet mass. In the histograms with magenta, blue and green markers, the groomed jet mass is computed from subjets that satisfy a corrJVF  &gt; 0.6 requirement, i.e. excluding subjets from pileup interactions. In the blue and green histograms, the subjets are further required to have p<sub>T</sub> <sup>subj</sup> / p<sub>T</sub> <sup>ungroomed</sup>  (f<sub> cut</sub>) of at least 4% and 10% respectively.
