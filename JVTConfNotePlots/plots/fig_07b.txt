Primary-vertex dependence of the hard-scatter jet efficiency for 20 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 30 GeV  (solid markers) and 30 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 40 GeV (open markers) jets for fixed cuts of  JVT  (blue) and JVF  (violet) such that the inclusive efficiency is 95%. The cut values imposed on JVT  and JVF, which depend on the p<sub>T</sub> bin, are specified in the legend.
