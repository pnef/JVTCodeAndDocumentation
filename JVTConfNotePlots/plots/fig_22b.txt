Distribution of the mass of the jet matched to the truth Z  boson for different trimming configurations based on corrJVF  and f<sub>cut</sub>. The blue shaded histogram shows the ungroomed jet mass. Distribution of jet mass for calorimeter- and track-based trimming configurations and jet cleansing. The histogram represented by magenta markers shows the trimmed jet mass, where the mass is computed from the subjets that have a p<sub>T</sub> <sup>subj</sup> / p<sub>T</sub> <sup>ungroomed</sup> of at least 5% (f<sub>cut</sub> = 0.05). For the green and black histograms, jet cleansing is used.
