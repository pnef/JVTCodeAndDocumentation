Efficiency vs. fake rate curve for JVT evaluated on 20 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 50 GeV  jets from a sample of Z to &mu;&mu; events. The curve represented by solid magenta markers are obtained when deriving the  JVT likelihood on a QCD dijet sample. For the open blue markers, the JVT likelihood was derived from Z  to &mu;&mu; events. No significant sample dependence is observed.
