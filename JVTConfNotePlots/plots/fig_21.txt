Correlation of subjet p<sub>T</sub>  fraction and subjet corrJVF  for anti-k<sub>t</sub> R=1.0 jets with p<sub>T</sub> &gt;300 GeV  and |&eta;| &lt;1.5. The dotted line indicates the standard calorimeter-based trimming p<sub>T</sub> ratio cut of 5%. Calorimeter-based trimming would remove all subjets that are below the dotted line, including those with large  corrJVF  values at the lower right.
