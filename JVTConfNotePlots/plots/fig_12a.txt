corrJVF  distribution for the leading jet with 20&lt;p<sub>T</sub> &lt;50 GeV and |&eta;|&lt;2.4 in Z (&mu;&mu;)+jets events, where the |&Delta; &phi;(Z , jet)| requirement is omitted. The blue shaded histogram representing the inclusive simulation is subdivided in its hard-scatter jet and pileup jet contributions using blue and magenta markers.  The gray band in the ratio plot represents the statistical uncertainty in the simulation.
