Dependence of the hard-scatter jet efficiency for 20 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 30 GeV  (solid markers) and 30 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 40 GeV  (open markers) jets as a function of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing &mu;. Fixed cuts of  JVT  (blue) and  JVF  (violet) are imposed such that the inclusive efficiency is 95%. The cut values imposed on  JVT  and JVF , which depend on the p<sub>T</sub> bin, are specified in the legend.
