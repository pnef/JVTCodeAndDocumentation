Primary-vertex dependence of the hard-scatter jet efficiency for 20 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 30 GeV  (solid markers) and 30 &lt; p<sub>T</sub>  &lt; 40 GeV  (open markers) jets for fixed cuts of R<sub>pT</sub>  (blue) and JVF  (violet) such that the inclusive efficiency is 90%. The cut values imposed on R<sub>pT</sub>  and  JVF, which depend on the p<sub>T</sub>  bin, are specified in the legend.
