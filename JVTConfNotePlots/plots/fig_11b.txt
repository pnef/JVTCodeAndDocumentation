Comparison between data and simulation for R<sub>pT</sub>  in a hard-scatter enriched selection of jets in Z (&mu;&mu;)+jets events, where a |&Delta;&phi;(Z,jet)|&gt;2.6 requirement is imposed between the leading jet and the Z  boson. The blue shaded histogram representing the inclusive simulation is subdivided in its hard-scatter jet and pileup jet contributions using blue and magenta markers respectively. The gray band in the ratio plot represents the statistical uncertainty in the simulation.
