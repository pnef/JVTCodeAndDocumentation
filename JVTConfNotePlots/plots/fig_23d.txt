Fake-rate versus efficiency curves for R<sub>pT</sub>  for three different track-to-vertex associations: the ``|&Delta; z &times; sin&theta;| &lt; 1 mm'' criteria labeled ``Trk-to-Vtx 1'', ``Step 1'' labelled ``Trk-to-Vtx 2'' and the full new procedure ``Step 1&2'' labelled ``Trk-to-Vtx 3''. For b-quark initiated jets, the performance gain for R<sub>pT</sub> of the new method stems from ``Step 2'': without ``Step 2'' the new method would perform worse than the ``|&Delta; z &times; sin&theta;| &lt; 1 mm'' based association.
