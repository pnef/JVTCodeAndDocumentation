ProofAna
=======================
This repository contains the most important parts of ProofAna code I've been using. 

This ProofAna code is used to:
 * Read NTUP_COMMON D3PDs 
 * Perform a matching of reco jets to truth jets to define pileup and hard-scatter jets 
 * Compute JetVertex Tagging information and related variables 
 * Write out small ROOT ntuples that are later used to produce plots, using e.g. the plotting macros from [JVTConfNotePlots/macros](../JVTConfNotePlots/macros)
